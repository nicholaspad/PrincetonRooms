"2006-03-09"{"Scully has air conditioning, which is nice.  My \"conjoined single\" setup was fantastic because the person in the connected single was my best friend.  We share a bathroom, which is something I would not want to do with any more than one roommate.  Freshman year, I was in a 7-guy suite with a shared bathroom, and it was GROSS.  Sharing a bathroom with just one other guy can work.  Basically, this room has an inner closet/hallway thing that connects the two singles (it's not considered a double because we  each have our own door to the main building hallway, and we each have our own phone number and address).  The closet/hallway/bathroom connector is really cool cuz you can pile lots of stuff in there and try to keep your bedroom relatively organized.  The absolute worst part of Scully is that it is so far from everything.  10 minute walk to Colonial Club.  Location is important to me, so this was definitely a drawback.  Still, everything considered, I was happy having Scully 152 for my senior year, given that I was connected to my best bud."{"4"{"Witherspoon"{"516"{"122"{"1"{"0"{"1"{"5"{"PU"
"2007-11-27"{"A177 used to be part of the assistant master's suite. The closet is really large because it was a kitchen once. I lived in the room the first year after it was converted into a dorm, and it was a 5-man affair that year. Even with 5 guys we had a lot of room, so I imagine it's pretty spacious as a quad. \

"2006-03-09"{"The room is ADA compliant, which means it has a very large bathroom, a fairly big shower with a seat in it, and a low peep-hole. You basically have to know what people are wearing in order to tell who it is outside your door. The usable living space in the room itself (outside the bathroom) is a lot smaller than that of most of the other doubles in the main inn. Also, the ceiling is quite low--I have a loft, and I sleep about 2 feet away from the ceiling. I cannot sit up in bed, and I hit my head a LOT; if you draw into 312 Forbes, I would not recommend lofting your bed, even though you might want to in order to free up some space in this rather small room. Some positives are that the room has a great view of the golf course and two closets built into the wall (instead of the armoires that some rooms have). Also, the hallway-type space leading into the room is wide enough to put your dresser and/or fridge in, to free up some space in the main area of the room. All told, I have been fine living in 312 Forbes this year, but would have preferred most other doubles in the main inn over this one. "{"3"{"Witherspoon"{"112"{"104"{"1"{"0"{"1"{"1"{"PU"
"2006-03-09"{"While the 134 sq feet might lead you to think its a small room, it actually feels MUCH larger than any of the rooms on the first through third floors.  This is because the ceiling is about 19 ft high, which makes it feel spacious.  The windows in Scully are small but the southern exposure of the room means it gets plenty of daylight. I am rating this a  good room because it's probably one of the best singles if you're looking in Scully.

\
We moved all the beds into the smaller room, and made the larger one a common room. This was pretty sweet because the larger room has access to the roof over the auxiliary dining hall through the window. \

"2007-11-27"{"I lived here my sophomore year and loved it. So the pluses: The room gets morning sunlight, has a gorgeous view onto the golf course, and is pretty quiet at night. The size of the room is also quite nice, and it is located close to a woman's bathroom and the kitchen (so all very convenient).\
\
The negatives: It is directly across from the staircase, which is not a problem in regard to people coming in/out (Forbes isn't that frequented) but an issue when the door-being-propped-open-too-long sound goes off (which happened quite frequently). When I lived there, the heating was also extremely loud. I've been in rooms in Brown, Murray-Dodge that also have loud heating, but this was louder. The sound was more of a shrill high sound with big clunking sounds (I learned to sleep throught it). The Forbes addition is also more disconnected from the rest of Forbes (and farther away from campus, although once you make it to Forbes, I don't think the difference is that great).\
\
I would highly recommend this room to those who are looking for a quiet space, like to wake up to the morning sun, and enjoy the single life (living with friends nearby is also a way to have the best of the social and solitary worlds)."{"4"{"Witherspoon"{"306"{"113"{"1"{"0"{"1"{"3"{"PU"

The location (north wing Scully) is fine too, only 2 mins from Frist, just as close as from Brown, though I have a bike for trips to Nassau.

The rooms are for the most part brightly lit, the floors are wooden and gorgeous, and each single has its own air conditioning control. The windows are huge. I have 9 windows in my single. \
\
Housing in Bloomberg tends to have really crappy sound insulation because every door has about an inch and a half gap between it and the floor, but this problem is easily fixed by adding a little plastic strip on the bottom of the door. This has been done for the doors in 381.\
\
You should know that the showers in 381, 281, 181, and 481 are all on a different waterline from the rest of Bloomberg, which results in our occasionally having to wait upwards of 15 minutes for the hot water to arrive in our shower. In addition, the water pressure generally sucks.\

I personally am a huge fan of Bloomberg as a dorm; I firmly believe the insides of Bloomberg make it easily the best dorm on campus. The one thing about it is, of course, the location.

"2007-11-27"{"Overall this is a great room for four people to live in very comfortably.  Despite being in the lower third of Wilson quads in terms of square footage, this room's positives easily make up it.  One of the two bedrooms is smaller than the other but you can easily fit the beds and either the dressers or desks in the room without bunking the beds.  In the second room, we easily fit the unbunked beds, dressers and desks with ample floor space.  The bedrooms also have large closets with built-in shelves and additional shelves at the ceiling level.  The common room is spacious enough to have a futon, tv, 2 desks, refrigerator and more easily.\
\
The location is Perfect!!  We had our own bathroom just steps from our door, laundry a floor down and the wilson game room a floor down aswell.  In addition to being the closest dorm to Frist, the Street and Wilcox, it's one of closest dorms to Poe Field and the varsity Athletics facilities.\

The room does have a few minor disadvantages. First of all, it's on the parking-lot side of the building.  While I didn't have any problems with noise (it's a quiet parking lot), there's not a great view.  Also, it gets sunlight in the afternoon (not morning), and isn't very sunny ever. I think the potted plants I kept in my room would have been happier with a sunnier window. The walls are thin, and you can hear what's happening in other rooms.  But, because it's on a hallway of mostly singles, it tended to be pretty quiet.  There's a bathroom directly down the hallway, but it has only one stall and one shower.  That wasn't much of an inconvenience, though, probably because there aren't that many people living on the hallway anyway.\

And granted, the space is nice.  However, there are no singles in the suite, which means you and your suitemates will have to choose how you're going to divy up the four (very differently-sized) doubles.  You'll also have to clean the bathroom.  And deal with the crazy, possessed radiators.  The back two bedrooms can get annoying noise-wise, especially on Saturday nights when everyone's stumbling back loudly from the Street.  While we didn't utilize the room to its full potential, it is a lot of space to fill up.  You're also not on a floor with anyone else, but rather on a landing between the entryway door and the first floor.\

These negatives aside, the room does offer a nice view of the Wilson quad (straight onto the volleyball court) and has a nice, big green \"backyard\" behind it for your use if you so choose to use it.

"2007-11-27"{"I lived in this suite freshman year and I think it's the nicest suite in Wilson substance free housing. Not that this is saying much, but it is still pretty nice with a huge common room and a private bathroom. We had 9 people living in the suite (2 singles, 2 doubles one big and the other tiny and a huge triple which is the room I lived in, and personally my favorite) This year the suite is for 8 people so I'm assuming that the really small double is going to be used as a single, which is probably how it was originally intended. The triple in addition to having more space than even three very messy people could possibly use also has the biggest closets, one of them with a full length mirror on the door. You can fit in three desks, three dressers, two bookcases and a shoe-rack and you don't even have to bunk the beds! Yay! Also, the common room has the potential to be very nice though it has two doors next to each other which lead to the same hallway for now apparent reason.\
As far as the cons go, one of the common room windows leaks and the sink and shower drains in the bathroom get clogged every so often necessitating a regular correspondence with Facilities.This is inconvenient butwe just used the public bathroom which is just down the hall whenever this happened and it usually got fixed really soon.\

However, with only 7 people, this room would be amazing.  In fact, I would say it's the best large suite in Wilson, mostly due to its large L-shaped common room.  Most of the large suites have big rectangular common rooms, with bedrooms off a long hallway.  But with the L-shaped common room, all the bedrooms except for one are right off the common room, which makes the space feel more open.  "{"4"{"Witherspoon"{"212"{"110"{"1"{"0"{"1"{"2"{"PU"
"2006-03-10"{"I give this a '3' with some reservations.  I was actually reasonably pleased with the room for the year I lived in it.  (I had wanted a single at all costs, and I got one.)  It's just that the room is really, really small and the furniture probably can't be moved.  122 square feet may seem like a lot (that's the size of a standard Butler single) but the room is sort of L-shaped, so a lot of that space is taken up by the door and entry to the room.  Add to that a seriously oversized wardrobe, desk, bed, and dresser, and there's not much living space left.  Lofting the bed might be beneficial; I didn't try.  The high-set window opens out to the back landing of Blair Arch, so you will hear archsings and people can easily look into your room if the shade is not drawn.  Still, it's a Mathey single, which have historically been in short supply and high demand.  Some of these things I've pointed out as downsides may be upsides for different people.  By the way, bathrooms, laundry, and the Blair \"cafe\" are on the same floor.  Also, the room is the one nearest the elevator, for easy move-in.

"2007-11-27"{"This was my freshman year room.  While it didn't seem terrible, in retrospect it has to have been one of the smaller quads in Mathey.  The common room is large enough for small gatherings, but the bedrooms are really dark and narrow.  The beds have to be bunked, and I think only one desk will fit in each bedroom if both of the dressers are in there.  There are two closets, next to each other, each with two hanging bars one behind the other.  Good roommates are a prerequisite for this room.\
\
There's also the annoyance of outlet placement... The outlet and ethernet are on opposite walls, so you've got to find a way to rig it that Public Safety won't complain about.  We ran wires over the door.\

Furniture included: bed, desk, chair, 3x2 drawer dresser, fixed wardrobe w/ 2 drawers.  When I first got this room I had mixed feelings about the L-shape.  However, the effect is that of a hallway into your room -- it sort of opens out into the space.  Well-lit, with three fixtures.\

Also, to state the obvious: having a private bathroom is really great, even despite cleaning responsibilities.\

Scully has long tall windows that let in a lot of light but have deep windowsills.  However I would advise not putting anything important on the sills as the windows have been known to leak after heavy rains or snowfalls.  In addition, there is a noticeable draft from the window.

You can easily fit 3-4 couches/futons in here. Moreover, because the staircase is \"unsupported,\" you can squeeze a dresser underneath it if you wish.  There is also a bathroom branching off of the common room (which you will need to clean yourself), a room we used as a rather small double, and a decently-sized single.\
\
Upstairs, there is another bathroom, which also needs to be cleaned, a gigantic double with a great view of the Wilson quad, another rather large double with a kind of bad view of Gauss/Whitman, and two singles, one which looks out on Wilcox, another which looks out Gauss.\
\
All in all, I have enjoyed living here this year. The people in the rooms facing 211 Gauss get some noise during party nights, but it hasn't ever been too much of an issue for me. There is an absolute ton of space in this suite, but a lot of dust collects around the suite, and with nine guys, the bathrooms tend to get dirty quickly. Moreover, at least at the beginning of the year, walking to the third floor every time you need something is annoying, although I hardly noticed it by October. \
\
However, having what is probably the third-biggest common room of any room on campus (trailing the Zoo and 211 Gauss) makes up for it. This room has been sub-free for the last two years and will probably remain so into the foreseeable future. We had a somewhat mediocre draw time in Wilson sub-free draw and still got the room, so go for it!"{"4"{"Edwards"{"403"{"170"{"1"{"0"{"2"{"4"{"PU"

The most notable con about 134 is that one of the two bedrooms is pretty small (the other is very large).  We decided to double loft the beds in that room (with desks below) and it worked out great; i recommend it if you don't mind being in a lofted bed.  We then switched rooms mid-year as the other double is much larger and doesn't require any bunking/lofting.\
\
By double lofting in the smaller room we freed up plenty of space in the common room which is fairly large and has a nice windowsill seat to go along with it.  134 is one of the best locations on campus, with a nice overlook of the junior slums on one side and Dillon gym on the other.  The 13th entryway is right outside the main entrance to Dillon which is pretty convenient, as is the nearby printer/laundry room in the underground level.

There is A/C and forced air heating attached to a thermostat in this room, so that you can control the climate a lot more than most rooms any time of year.  There are four rooms, two larger ones and two smaller ones.  This means that you can either get four singles or two singles, a double and a common room (we had the former, which worked great).  The private bathroom is nice, although you have to clean it yourself so consider that if you have really messy roommates.

"2007-11-27"{"I really enjoyed living in Scully 318.  Though it's a little bit far from the main part of campus, you get used to the walk pretty easily.  Scully is also a great building--relatively new, and with a lot of nice features, like self-controlled air conditioning and heating.  I especially liked this room, too, since it's right next door to the lounge (with TV), kitchen (partial, not full: microwave and instant hot water spout, no oven or stovetop), study room with nice tables (good place to work), and print release station (just down the hall = SO convenient).  The room is also right by the elevator, which makes moving in and getting to your room super easy.  Note that the third floor of Scully is all connected, whereas the first and second floors aren't--I think this actually makes the third floor of Scully a more desirable place to live than the second floor because of how easily you can get between sections of the building.  Laundry is also close by: either up one floor (directly above you) or down two floors (right below the print release station).  And, if your roommate is hogging the bathroom, there's a bathroom right next door to you (next to the elevator) and the bathrooms on the fourth floor also have additional showers and stalls.  The proximity to the elevator and lounge do not present any noise problems.\
\
In terms of the room itself, it's pretty nice.  The L-shape is a little strange to get used to at first, since the closet is nailed down right next to the door.  However, my roommate and I had quite different setups, and both worked really well: I managed to fit my bed, desk, side table, couch, and bookshelves without a problem, whereas he set up a bit more sparsely, with the furniture that comes with the room + a big lounge chair with footrest.  His setup (the sparser variety) left a LOT of floor space to work with; mine was nice since I had a couch.  You could probably pull off a futon with the bed, too, although this does cut into your floor space.\
\
The room has a huge window that looks out over Poe Field, which is beautiful, along with high ceilings.  318 is slightly different from most of the other rooms in this part of Scully in that the window ledge is rectangular (as opposed to having the triangular window that sticks out, which I think every other room has).  This means your window is one long flat piece of glass as opposed to two panels that are concave...Though a little bit different at first, and perhaps hard if you're planning on putting a TV there, it's a great shelf and quite easy to put your desk by the window and look out on the beautiful weather outside you.\
\
Having your own bathroom is of course a huge plus, too.\
\
Pick this room with a roommate you like, but want to have your own space with too.  A great room for junior draw--and if I had gotten a bad time in senior draw, I would have seriously considered living here again!  "{"4"{"Edwards"{"310"{"166"{"1"{"0"{"1"{"3"{"PU"
"2007-11-27"{"This room is a great single!  Though long and slightly narrow in shape, it's one of the biggest singles in Wilson, and has the advantage of being on the first floor, which makes for easily running in and out of your room in between classes (which I did frequently!)  The closet is also quite large--I think it might be the same size closet as many people get in Wilson doubles.\
\
Be aware that part of the space is almost completely unusable because of the way the door opens into the room: I only managed to put a shoe rack there. \

Nevertheless, I managed to fit a bed, couch, side table, and desk comfortably in this room.  It's a good choice by any standard.\

It is a comfortably sized room, however it is reasonably difficult to arrange furniture in the room to maximize open space because the closet is nailed to the wall right next to the door and there is a slanted ceiling that spans almost half of the room.  The other half of the ceiling is particuarly nice because it is really high but the slanted ceiling severly limits where you can put things and either the desk or bed must go under the slant.  Also, the window is in the slanted ceiling and faces north and so there is little light that enters the room although the other lighting in the room is particularly good.  The bed is raised so that is useful for storage and the room has its own thermostat (it just controls the heat, no A/C).  I was able to squeeze a bed, desk, large bookshelf (although one comes with the room), microfridge, and tv into the room, but space was kind of cramped with only about 16 sq ft of walking room.

Like the singles in Dod, it has the advantage of being in a new building in a pretty good location, but it's much bigger than those rooms.  It's also bigger than most of the other singles on the third floor of Little.\
\
I generally enjoy being on the third floor because it's a bit quieter and you have nice views of campus (from this room there's a great view southward towards the junior slums).  I think it's definitely worth the extra couple of flights up, especially if you like some peace and quiet.  The room is in the corner of the building on the opposite side of the hall from the rest of the rooms, so on the other side of your walls you don't have any neighbors--check the maps to see what I mean.  And the bathrooms (both men's and women's) are really convenient, just right across the hall.\
\
Generally the room is just a little bit quirky, but in a good way.  The door is offset from the main room, and there's a step up right when you enter.  The ceiling is sloped on two sides, but it's pretty high and doesn't make the room feel cramped at all.  The two windows on perpendicular walls give the room lots of natural light.  I find that there's something nice about living in a room that's not just a boring rectangular box."{"5"{"Dod Hall"{"307"{"120"{"1"{"0"{"1"{"3"{"PU"

Though the addition actually has air conditioning, they don't turn it on during the school year.  So, it was boiling during the fall and spring.  The room also got really hot in the winter due to an overactive heater.\

The room is on the golf course side.  So, while you have a great view, you are isolated from the majority of the addition rooms.  \

Pros:\
1) Big bedrooms for a triple! If you have the single, you can have a king-size bed (two twins), a big desk, and your dresser... as long as you don't mind having almost no floor space. For a double, you can definitely debunk and still have your desks in the room, as long as you move the dressers into the common room.\
2) Regular floor plan. No awkward nooks to fill; rooms are rectangular.\
3) Thick walls. Can't hear my neighbors.\
4) Lots of sun. Bedrooms get it in the morning, common room in the afternoon.\
5) Central location, looks out onto both Cuyler and 1903 courtyards (can be a little loud sometimes with the windows open).\
6) Lots of closet space.\
7) Doors can be left unlocked.\
8) Pierre is a great janitor.\

Cons:\
1) Bathroom is in basement (221 is on the second floor). However, it's really big (6 showers, 4 stalls, 6 sinks), and I've never had to wait for anything.\

\
This room is a little quirky because it is handicap-accessible. However, it's usually still available after special-needs draw.\

That means there's a huge bathroom and a big shower with a folding bench. A definite perk on days after a long practice. There are also closets built into the wall, which are pretty small.\

Walls are thin, so you'd better like your neighbors, and the lighting is poor, so you'll need a lamp.

I learnt to let the top window open and stuff the opening with a blanket, and had no more issue after that.

Cons: The entire 3rd floor is infested by centipedes and you will definitely have some 'interesting' moments trying to deal with them.

The heating is very high and non-adjustable, and the bathrooms (while very close to this room) are not cleaned very often.  There is a kitchen on the third floor, but the microwave has been broken for about a month and a half now.  The room itself is very small and narrow, ideal if you are a minimalist but not if you're a pack rat like myself.  The \"closet\" is actually a rod running along one side of the room; again, not so good for people with a lot of stuff.  Also keep in mind that this room is on the FOURTH FLOOR, which can be good for the glutes but is a bit of a pain when you have to hike four flights several times a day."{"2"{"Dod Hall"{"101N"{"460"{"3"{"0"{"3"{"1"{"PU"

As with all other rooms in the 1938 courtyard, the daily trash collection at 9am is annoying.  On a side note, make sure to keep the common room clean because the smell will permeate throughout the suite....and the stairwell...and the girls room across the hall...and the suite upstairs...and no one will like you.

Benefits: \
*It's 185 sq.ft, which is 5 sq.ft bigger than most Addition doubles.\
*The room is part of a suite that also includes a single.\
*It's on the best side of the Addition (outwards facing the golf course, with a nice view, and far from the commotion of Alexander Street)\

Negatives:\

*It is in a heavily-trafficked area (on the first floor and next to the staircase), so it is unusually loud compared to other parts of the Addition.\

The shape is a little weird, since the room occupies half of the hexagonal tower.  However, that means you get windows on two sides, including a bay window with window-seat looking out over Whitman: beautiful view.  I built my bed into the window-seat, which I strongly recommend doing--it really opens up the room, making both the window-seat and the main part of the room more accessible: you end up with a living room, bedroom, and dressing room area.\
\
Pros:  Fireplace, bay window, huge size, right next to elevator, great view, right by women's restroom, lounge and print release station on the same floor, laundry room straight downstairs via elevator, neat nooks and crannies, great location, relatively new building, beautiful sunlight streaming through window-seat window in morning (perfect angle!)\

\
negatives: this room was NOT designed for 6 people (unless you don't want to have a common room); all 4 rooms are different sizes and odd shapes; 1939 is a dorm-only building (no printer, cluster, kitchen, lounge, water fountain/hot water tap, etc.); not fun to move in to in the summer"{"3"{"Blair"{"73"{"496"{"4"{"1"{"3"{"1"{"PU"
"2007-11-27"{"As a junior, any of the 2 room doubles are about as good as it gets unless you're lucky enough to have an awesome draw time. The guys I was drawing with all wanted singles (as did I), and even though we didn't have a terrible draw time (middle of the second day), none of the up campus rooms that we could have drawn into were terribly great. The quads were all small and all the singles were located all over the place. That being said, Scully 2 room doubles have a lot going for them. You have ample space in your room and you get your own private bathroom to share with your roommate as well. There is a little bit of hall space for when you enter the double and then doors leading to each person's individual room. You'll have a toilet and sink to one side of the hall space and a shower and sink on the other. The hall space is big enough that you'll have space for a fridge or shoe rack or crates or whatever else you might like. \
\
One of the great things about scully is the air conditioning. At the beginning and end of the year, while all your friends are sitting around sweating in their rooms, you get to be cool and dry. Also, there's a lot of study rooms scattered throughout the building, so if you need to work on a problem set with other people, you can get them to come down to you rather than trudging your way over to frist or the library. Did I mention that the laundry machines and print cluster are just a floor down from 368? Unlike a lot of other laundry rooms on campus, the laundry room here usually isn't terribly busy. So the days of walking through the rain 2 buildings over with your 3 weeks worth of laundry only to find that none of the machines are available are over. \
\
As for the downside, there are no common rooms really in scully, which means no big parties really. But that's what up campus is for, right? Also, despite having hallways, scully just isn't a terribly lively place. On the flipside, if you're looking for a room that will be fairly quiet, this is it. Finally, scully really does put some physical distance between you and your friends who might live further up campus. At least you're probably just as far away from classes and the street as all of them. The only difference is that you get a little extra exercise trekking up hill.\
\
So on the whole scully 368 and any of the 2 room doubles in scully aren't really a bad place to spend your junior year. You get all the benefits of a single and all the comforts of a relatively new building. Enjoy. "{"5"{"Blair"{"72"{"215"{"2"{"1"{"1"{"2"{"PU"
"2007-11-27"{"This room's very pleasant in terms of size: you could have a queen bed in here, no problem. The window sticks, so in the winter, it's hard to allow yourself to have it open...because you'll be afraid that you won't be able to get it closed. It's right by the door entrance, which is nice for moving in/out and accessibility, but scary if you hear loud noises on Thursday and Saturday nights. One night I heard glass breaking from the doorway; someone threw a rock or something. \
\
There's no closet, which is horrible. The nearest bathroom with a shower is all the way on the other side of the building. But you're really close to the computer cluster and the laundry. Sometimes the hallway smells, and you feel a bit closed off - there's only four people in separate singles in this section.\

It's really close to the Art Museum, and equidistant (about) from Frist and Mathey Dining Hall. The U-Store is right there, too. \

"2007-11-27"{"This is by far the best room on campus. If you have 9 other good friends who are up for it and don't mind the sub free status, go for it. You won't get the chance to live in such an awesome big suite ever again while you're at Princeton. The suite is over 2000 sq. feet, and each of the individual bedrooms are probably anywhere from 140 to 200 sq. ft. each, so it's not like anyone will be squeezed for space. You can fit in at least a couple couches, a large TV, tables, shelves, etc... just about whatever you want (like a tiki hut). And yes, you must go outside to do laundry and to use a print cluster. And DO does indeed have a little ant problem.\
\
But this is all missing the point. When else in your life will you have the chance to live with NINE other guys in the same room? Probably never. So do it now. If you're lucky enough to get one of the singles, you'll have plenty of personal space for when you need it. But nothing can beat being in a large suite with all your friends.

"2007-11-27"{"First off, our draw group ended up absolutely loving this quad, but there are a few things to keep in mind.  You must visit it to get an appreciation for how the slanted walls (because it is at the very top of Little) decrease the effective square footage.  Over half the wallsspace in the bedrooms cannot have closet or bunkbed against them because they slope sharply inward.  It took us at least a week of rearranging our furniture on a daily basis before we hit upon a setup which confortably allowed us to keep out beds (unbunked), desks, closets, and dressers all in the bedrooms, which freed the common room for maximum space.  \
\
The laundry situation from this room is good, but not great.  You can get to the Little machines without leaving the building, but it is a convoluted path.\

There also will be people who walk, smoke (occasionally), and have long conversations in the passageway under the triple long into the night.\

Then the main bedroom is extremely spacious, with space for the two beds of course (and even more space if you bunk them as we did) and then a futon/tv area. Also, the closets are huge.

The heat to the room stopped working before the start of winter so HVAC had to provide me with a radiator.\
Despite the small size and the external closet, it can accommodate the provided furniture comfortably under the right arrangement. But don't expect to fit in much more than a minifridge. The window gets lots of sun during the day and provides a good view of the quad below, which could be a negative next year since it it my understanding that landscaping work will be performed on it (who knows how long or noisy it will be).\

Pros:\
I had this room my sophomore year and it was AMAZING - especially when you realised it was 50% bigger than the single next door.  It's close to bathrooms, has 4 panels of windows, and a cute little nook in the wall as a closet space. I actually had 2 beds in this single room, one which served as a lounging area, and a coffee table.\
\
Possible Cons (that didn't bother me too much):\
The heater probably hasn't been adjusted in 30 years so when I adjusted it, it seemed like some dark steam was coming out. I really wasn't that bad - I probably already aired it out for the next person. Also, its on the ground floor and up a little from the dumpsters - so for those people that are light sleepers that sleep in, you might need to get used to being woken up by dump trucks at about 10.30am. \

Firstly lets handle the possible drawbacks:\
1) 4th Floor: No not worry, it's right by the stairs and there is an elevator.\
2) The shower water takes 15 minutes to warm up. [Nothing you can do here.\
\
Positives:\
15 foot Ceilings make the rooms seem HUGE!!!\
Good view, windows facing east / south so you do actually get natural sunlight during the winter.\
\
Room setup:\
We set up the room to have 4 singles.  Two of the room members have 2x beds in their singles for extra comfort and still have room for their desks, dresser and closet like cabinet.\
\
One of the room is large enough that you could make a double and have a comfortably sized common room.  [One of our bedrooms doubles as a common room]\
\
The entrance from the hall is wide enough that you can have a refrigerator or other tables (think Beer Pong).\

Location:\
Less than 5 minutes to Frist, 10 to WaWa, 10-15 to the Equad, ~8 to McCosh/ up campus, <5 to Icahn / McDonnell / Fine Hall / Poe Field\

"2007-11-27"{"Unlike the previous review, we didn't much issue with noise in 408, even despite the ongoing Whitman construction (which should no longer be an issue).  My room is on the south side of the building and I slept with my window open every single night.  The best feature of 408 is that it has 5 bedrooms; i.e. 4 singles.  The room is pretty much highly symmetrical; the four singles are essentially identical and the common room and the double are as well.\
\
The singles are by no means huge, but are quite sufficient to live comfortably.  Also, we didn't have an issue with too-thin walls.  I found them adequate; you're more liable to hear through the standard dorm doors than the walls.  The double is somewhat unusually shaped, but is pretty big.  As stated in the previous review, the common room is somewhat small for 6, but we made do just fine and fit in many more on two futons--I think putting the TV(s) in the fireplace area maximizes the number of seats.\
\
408 was also great for parties given the number of rooms and hallway.  The only issue we had with the room was that the room overlooks Elm, such that it  is easy for Public Safety to hear parties, but they were always pretty chill.\

The first reviewer was extremely accurate, so I will just add on the following:\
\
1. The pair in the double on the lower level of the suite should be people who go to sleep the latest and who don't mind noise because it opens out right into the common room.\
2. If you're reading this review as a pre-frosh, try to figure out who's rooming with whom before getting on campus. It makes moving in a lot easier if everyone already knows who their roommate is and which room they're going to live in. Plus, this way you'll avoid any roommate incompatabilities later in the year. This worked out so well for us that all three of the double pairs in this suite are staying with their roommate for next year. \

You can do a lot of things with the space.  The only drawback is that the annex is isolated from the rest of Forbes and campus, so live near friends if possible.  The building itself and the hallways are pretty rustic.  Also, the heat is very intense from the heater, and whether it turns on or off is controlled entirely by a sensor in the room next door, so make sure to tell your neighbor not to have the windows open on a summer night, because your heat will turn on and it will become unbearably hot in your room.\

It was great because I could talk with my roommate when I wanted to, or close the door when I was doing work or wanted to play music. The dorm is very cushy: elevator, kitchens, multiple laundry rooms, study spaces all within a short distance of the room. It is very quiet all the time. It overlooks Poe field and is close to Mol Bio classes and Lot 23. Believe it or not, it's about the same distance from the street as Brown, though of course it's uphill to get to meals. It takes 5 min to get to frist, and takes me less than 10 to get to the street. \

The downside is that scully is pretty quiet, which is nice when sleeping or studying, but can get old if you don't venture out.\

In the larger bedroom, you can debunk the beds, fit both dressers and desks... and still have privacy and a little room to dance! The other bedroom feels like prison: bunked beds, one desk, one dresser... and let me tell you, having your desk or dresser in the common room is a royal pain in the ass!\

Walker has zero amenities--no common spaces, soda machines, or laundry.  The closest laundry rooms are in Feinberg or 1903, but either way you have to walk down 3 flights of stairs first.

There is a shared private bathroom with 328, which you have to clean yourself (not a big deal). The room faces Poe field and gets direct sunlight in the mornings. Even though the room's lighting is more natural than the residential college yellow light, I still found a lamp to be good for the afternoons and evenings. It is a very clean building in general and new so you don't have to worry about bugs. 330 is a great location on the 3rd floor: garbage disposal is at one end of the hall, computer cluster is at the other end, and the elevator is somewhere in between, which means moving in and out is simple.\

A note about 330 itself: the previous resident really went to town on the walls and there are a lot of holes, pencil markings and stains on the walls. It is bearable but something to cover it all up is nice.\

One thing for non-science majors: the main part of campus is all uphill so whether you go to Frist, McCosh or Firestone, it can get annoying when it's hot and humid. Also, since it's removed from the main part of campus, forgetting your prox late at night can be an issue because only scully people will come around.\

"2008-03-02"{"Overall, this room is OK, although its designation as a triple in the 2007-08 year was not a great idea.  It will probably suffice as a double in 2008-09.\
\
The common room is quite large and can comfortably fit 3 desks, 3 drawers, a couch, a fridge, and a TV (which we stuffed into the fireplace).  Definitely capable of large parties if you're into it.  Walls are made of concrete/stone and not too susceptible to nailing.  Lighting isn't too great despite windows on 2 walls, because of the way the room is oriented.  Heating (like in most of the slums) is by hand adjusting valves on wall-side boilers.\
\
The real issue is that the bedroom is TINY -- as a triple this year, we could not fit the 3rd bed in the room even after bunking 2 beds, and the 3rd roommate had to resort to piling up mattresses stolen from the hallway.  It'll work much better as a double, although the dimensions of the room compared to the bed frames would still require either bunking or moving one bed into the common room.  There is one built-in closet in the bedroom, and 2 out in the common room.\
\
There is a private bathroom accessible only by walking through the bedroom.  It works fine other than the occasional drainage problem (Housing responded within the day when I called them up).  Although the little bathroom window is located directly beneath the Henry-Foulke archway, which enables eavesdropping during showers.\
\
The room is directly across the hall from an a capella group (the Tigerlilies).  Rehearsals are not loud enough to be annoying, although be prepared for their partying during the post-audition, pre-break, and pre-holiday seasons.  Something kind of unsettling is that there are rows of bike racks directly outside the windows of both the common room and bedroom -- when people deposit their bikes, it often feels like they're about to break into the room."{"3"{"Holder"{"105"{"461"{"4"{"0"{"3"{"2"{"PU"

The bathroom is a little iffy--it's painted a weird shade of yellow and the shelf is sort of gross, so bring your own storage.

"2008-03-26"{"  The rooms are a little small (beds need to be bunked if you plan to have all desks and dressers in the room) but is completely made up for by the fact that we have a gigantic common room with two huge windows with beautiful views. One window we've kept covered with a Pace (Italian for \"peace\") flag so our activities in the room aren't constantly on display. The other window isn't at eye-level so we get a beautiful view, but no one looking in. \
  There is no better location on campus. We're first floor, so moving in is a snap. We're closer to Frist than we are to Wilson. There's a computer cluster in nearby 1937. Best of all, laundry is just one flight of stairs down. Being central campus and at the intersection of so many roads, 101 Feinberg is also a great place to meet people, and we have lots of friends stop by the room just because it is on their way to and/or from class, activities, etc.\
  The room on the right has significantly more natural light, so if this is a major consideration, keep that in mind. Also, your computers will need to be wireless. The ethernet ports are in strange locations and may not work with the layout you want of the room.\
  The one reservation I have about this room is noise. You will get noise of people walking back from the street. Also, Feinberg is a great place for parties, so don't draw into this room if you expect your neighbors to be completely quiet on a Saturday night. Also, the heaters are water heaters that have a propensity for clanking. It worked out great for us because we're all deep sleepers. We weren't bothered by the noise. This is especially important because it sort of defeats the purpose of having such a great common room if one roommate needs absolute quiet when sleeping. If you're a very private person and can't stand the idea of people being able to see into your common room, then it might not be a such a great idea to draw into this room, either.\
  However, what are the other perks of this room? Well, there's the prox entry for one. You won't have to carry an extra key with you, you can just prox in! The private bathroom (just make sure you guys are willing to clean it). And, for the 2008-2009 year, your RCAs will be right downstairs in the Fishbowl, so free food and lots of fun whenever you want!\

Good: \
\
The Little basement isn't like other basements, since the building is built on a hill, and there are only rooms on the bottom side of the hill, so you get windows and a good view and it doesn't feel like a basement at all. \
\
Kitchen, men's bathroom, women's bathroom, printer, AND laundry room are in the immediate vicinity-- not even kidding, 50 feet (or something very short) in either direction of the room, in the same hallway. So convenient. You don't have to go outside to do anything.\
\
Near the U-store. Easy to duck out and grab a quick snack 24 hr/day.\
\
One wall (the long wall the was the other side of the hallway wall) was brick, stone, and had a mantle-like thing that you could set things on/decorate. The fact that it wasn't just plain white wall on all sides gave the room great atmosphere.\
\
One bedroom is HUGE-- same size as the common room. We kept our beds bunked, but definitely could have unbunked them and had room to spare.\
\
Bad:\
\
THis room is really more suited for a triple, since one of the bedrooms is twice the size of the common room. The smaller bedroom, however, is really cool... it's hard to describe, but there's a little brick archway within that bedroom that separates the sleeping/desk area from the two closet/wardrobes. Had to put one desk in the common room, and bunk the beds though.\

The first thing is to not expect anything different than the majority of Wilson (e.g. loud heating system, mediocre room quality, etc.) \

As it is a nine person suite with two levels and fairly thin walls, even day-to-day noise can be an issue. Likewise, when construction or maintenance occurs in Wilson, there can be a lot of vehicular noise in the early mornings on the side of the room overlooking the quad.  \

Dust seems to be a significant problem in the room, so cleaning should be routine and thorough.\

Major perks:  great size, two closets, quiet location on campus, right next to one of the holder printer clusters and a two minute walk from the UStore\
\
Things to consider: it's three flights up so move-in wasn't particularly fun.  Also, heaving a full laundry basket up and down four flights is a solid work out.  Joline has notoriously intense heating and the best location for the bed is right next to the radiator.  Only one window means limited lighting\

"2009-03-24"{"This room has one double, one single, and a common room. It's located down the hall from the kitchen, and one floor down from the Men's bathroom, 3 floors down from the Women's bathroom. It's not the biggest room, but it's really cozy. My roommates and I love it. It's perfect for entertaining small parties, and having the kitchen so close is convenient. The downsides: the bathrooms are kind of far and the kitchen became un-restricted this year (which means it's messier and your food is not as safe). All in all, we really like this room."{"3"{"Pyne"{"734"{"252"{"1"{"0"{"1"{"3"{"PU"
"2009-03-26"{"1. This room, being in Joline, is not on par in terms of interior quality with more modern, renovated dorms such as those in Blair, Little, and Hamilton. It has no thermostat, so you'll be completely dependent on the whim of the central heating system, which is excessive in the winter (and loud!). Because it is in the attic (basically), the air quality isn't spectacular -- it is still and somewhat stuffy. While you can alleviate that by opening the window, doing so will invite a consistent stream of bugs into the room. I also noticed a large insect (perhaps a centipede) almost enter the room through the radiator, so I had to seal it up with duct tape.\
\
2. In terms of noise, the walls are thick and the room is reasonably quiet, even on party nights.\
\
3. The bathrooms are close by, but they have extremely poor ventilation, and are inconsistently maintained by the janitor. Although they are better than those found in the basement, they are mediocre compared to the spacious and well-ventilated ones found in buildings like Blair.\
\
4. My roommate and I organized the dorm into two bedrooms, rather than a bedroom and a common room. This arrangement worked great -- although the inner room is very small, it fits everything you need without a problem (bed, desk, refrigerator, bookshelf, television, closet, etc.).\
\
In conclusion, if you are drawing in Mathey and would like a two-room double, I strongly recommend 231 Joline. Otherwise, there are better options, especially outside of Mathey (e.g. Scully). Thus, while the room is good, I simply cannot recommend it when compared to the many other options that are significantly superior."{"3"{"Pyne"{"733"{"145"{"1"{"0"{"1"{"3"{"PU"

Also, directly across from the microwave and drink machines - kitchen is a fair bit down the hall (at the other end of the building) and usually kept in a state of disrepair.

\
Cons: the room is more like a long rectangle instead of a square, men's bathroom is NOT next to the room despite what the floor plans indicate, it's right next to one of the Spoon quads which means you may hear noise from weekly pregaming and parties (I actually didn't care but if you're considered about noise, you're better off in Buyers than in Spoon), the building has no A/C so the first month of classes is death, the elevator breaks down on a weekly basis so you'll end up taking the stairs more than a few times\

The private bathroom has a toilet that flushes really loudly though, so that can be a bit annoying in the middle of the night, but nothing serious.

The floor plan is identical, but it's listed as 503 sq. ft. compared to the 451 for this room.  Basically, the 451 is the total usable space, without the hallway inside the room and the closets.\

The room itself is great. 1903's location alone makes it worth it, and the common room is pretty spacious.  The room looks over Prospect Garden, so it's quieter overall than the courtyard rooms, although it can still get kind of loud when people are coming back from the Street (though that's true of almost every room in this part of campus).\

The biggest downside is that there are only two bedrooms, and the double is a little cramped.  There's not enough room to debunk the beds, and there's only one closet in the bedroom, so you'll either have to share or have one person use the third closet in the room's hallway.

Also, there are two separate entrances to the quad, one of which communicates with the exterior staircase (so use that when going north or in warm weather) and you can prox straight into the room: no more getting locked out!  The other door communicates with the interior staircase (which looks like a missile silo in a James Bond flick) so use that when heading down campus or in cold weather.

The double one of the biggest in the main inn and is more than big enough to throw a couple parties. If you decided to loft one of the beds you could definitely fit a couch. Even without lofting you could probably fit a couch though it may be tight. We decided to just throw a ton of chairs in here when people came over.\
\
Great location, right across from the kitchen and above the computer cluster. The French doors are nice, but allow some noise to get in when Frats are holding their secret meetings in the backyard of forbes and the blinds don't cover the entirety of the door so you can't get the room totally dark.\

"2010-03-26"{"Despite the square footage, this is a pretty spacious room.  It's got a massive bay window which is beautiful (though has a cold draft in the winter).  We made a cushion out of mattress pads and it was super comfortable and a great place for friends to hang out or guests to sleep.\
\
The con of this room is the size of the bedroom - it can fit bunked beds, one desk, and one dresser tops (we also have a bookcase).  One tiny closet for both people.  Beds can't be unbunked.  But as the person on the top bunk, it's a high ceiling and it's a nice place to sit.\
\
There are smaller bathrooms upstairs for both sexes; the girls' one is really nice but gets crowded, so you can go down two floors to the basement if you want.  No laundry or printer in the building, which sucks, but if you're willing to sacrifice the big rooms in the slums for a room with a great location, this is a pretty great choice.

It's a little on the smallish side and kinda of awkwardly set up -- there is a slant in the ceiling and the window is recessed in a little alcove that you can't really fit anything into so it's kind of a waste of space. All in all though, there was plenty of room to accommodate me. There's a closet that's like a big wooden box  built into the wall, and you can hang stuff inside and there's also shelving inside so you can stack clothes.

-Being a fairly new room, it is clean, windows are not too drafty (though I had to have them fixed towards the end of the winter, so I don't know by how much it really fixed the draftiness of the windows during the coldest months).\
-The floor has both a computer cluster with printer, and another study room nearby.\

Cons:\
-When the AC is on, it is really on.  I have found this room to be generally colder than most other rooms on the floor, and it can be hard to find a happy medium between AC at full blast and it being entirely off.\
-The room is about equally far from both men's rooms (about 40-45 paces), though the women's rooms are closer.\
-Given the placement of the furniture and the size of the room, there is not a lot of wall space.

The best thing about this room is the huge common room (for a 6 person suite). Also, 1937 is right next to Frist so that's convenient, especially for late meal.

You're on the first floor so moving in/out is as good as it gets in the addition (which has no elevator). \
Even though it's the addition, you're relatively close to the dining hall, forbes office, and ping pong table. \
Even though it's only 115 sq ft, if you raise the bed to put a minifridge underneath, it's shaped in a way that you can comfortably fit standard furniture. \
\
\
Cons: You wasted your money if you bought a futon: it won't fit. The walls are paper-thin, but if your neighbors aren't too crazy it's not a big deal. \
\
Even though you're in Forbes, it takes three extra minutes to get to the Wa.\
\
My suggestion if you fall in the second half of draw times: Unless you can find a bigger room/ you want a room with a private bathroom instead of a shared one, this one is a keeper.

The room has a lot of extra surfaces -- storage up in the 'loft' and built in desks. These surfaces are awesome, imaginative people can find all sorts of wild things to do in this room. Even the windows, for example, can be used for exercise and stuff, if you are flexible enough. Although I heard they were going to put window screens in over the summer. \
\
The best part of this room is the men's bathroom. The shower doors are transparent which means you don't have to worry about what the last person to use the shower was doing in there, as most people aren't audacious enough to do anything gross when people can see them. \
\
The room doesn't have enough power outlets in it and is slightly awkwardly shaped, so make sure you bring lots of extension cords and find a system to move them off the floor before fire safety comes. \
\
All in all, it's a great room and great for extracurricular activities (You don't normally have to worry about public safety because sound doesn't really carry down to the ground floor.) \

\
One of the main problems about the room, however, is that one room is significantly smaller than the other. Both are actually about the same square feet - except one is extremely narrow. At only 5-6 feet wide, there's no way to un-bunk the beds without hitting the two dressers and shelves in the process. The other bad part about the smaller bedroom room is that there really isn't much of a closet. Both rooms have dressers with five drawers, but they're pretty shallow drawers. Eventually, you decide that you need to hang up some clothes...and then you see a small alcove divided into 2 parts with 2 closet rods. The rods are literally less than 1.5' per person. Try not to bring too much stuff if you can avoid it (plus it's three floors up - no elevator). The bigger bedroom has four closet rods a lot more space for clothing.\
\
There's not much lighting either so be prepared to bring a bright desk lamp.\

"2011-02-28"{"We split the room into two singles - one is smaller than the other so the bigger single doubled as the common room. \
\
Our biggest difficulty was figuring out where to put the bed in the bigger room - it looked like it would only fit either pushed up against the window seat, completely blocking it, or blocking the fireplace. Finally though we figured out how to fix the bed perpendicular to the window actually supported by the window seat (and a couple cinder blocks. It was very sturdy and worked out extremely well and we still had access to the majority of the window seat.\
\
There is a bathroom on the bottom floor - however it is a bit of a long walk (it's by entryway 1 whereas this room is entryway 4). The men's bathroom is slightly closer (entryway 3). There is also a very small kitchen (with sink, oven, stove and microwave) on the bottom floor for people who like to cook their own meals.\
\
Being on the ground floor was an adjustment. I really loved having the window shades open but people walking by are only two feet away from your window and can definitely see straight in. However being on the bottom floor does have its perks in the summer time when you leave your windows open and forgot your prox - you can just climb in your window!\

I would definitely suggest getting some storage cubes/whatever to put under the bed (after you lift the bed to its highest position) and put the dresser INSIDE the closet for some extra room. After putting the dresser inside the closet, it opened up enough room for a microfridge. There is still plenty of closet space (I can still walk into it with the dresser inside!) so don't hesitate to take advantage of how large it is.\

You get a lot of good natural light from the window, and the tree outside is a nice little touch. I'd still suggest bringing a lamp or two for working/studying or reading in bed.\

Dodge Osborn was sub-free this year, so it's pretty quiet. You will be VERY close to the Zoo (11-person suite) and you can definitely hear their music/screaming/etc. if they do party, but generally it's pretty low-key due to the sub-free status.\

However, living in a single on the side facing Little is extremely frustrating. The room is small (made smaller by the chimney jutting out), and even with the window open there is barely any circulation.

The walls have no insulation, meaning you can hear your neighbors' music/conversations/video chats (best remedy is to have a fan on constantly). Also, even if your radiator is turned off, your neighbor's heat will still keep your room around 70/75 degrees. (Too hot for me, but perhaps others will find this appealing.)\

"2011-03-01"{"We got this room after being put on the waitlist, and it is pretty much as expected for a waitlist room. The bedrooms in this room are TINY. you basically can't debunk the beds, unless you are ok with your bed touching your roommate's bed. One of the bedrooms does have a bay window though, which is a nice place to put your desk. the common room is a good size, but it is awkwardly shaped. there are two fairly large closets, but there are only 3 bars for hanging clothes (2 in one and 1 in the other), so someone doesn't get to hang their clothes. Also, the closets are extremely awkwardly shaped and don't have any light source (and there are no outlets inside), so it's really hard to see inside when you're looking for something. On the topic of outlets, this room is SEVERELY lacking in outlets: each bedroom only has 1, and the common room only has 2 (on opposite sides of the room). We ended up using literally around a dozen extension cords to get everything plugged in in somewhere where it could be used. Also the room gets unbearably hot in the winter, and the windows must be left open basically all the time, except if you have your desk near a window, in which case no matter how much you close the window it's still going to be freezing because the windows are very poorly insulated. The floors are also in really bad condition, with large gaps between some of the tiles--stuff (e.g. vomit) gets stuck in them and are really hard to get out. The room is quite far from bathrooms: you either have to go up one flight of stairs and down a long hallway to use a tiny, poorly ventilated, rarely cleaned bathroom, or down two flights of stairs to use a larger basement bathroom that is perpetually in a state of sustained filth. Basically, avoid this room like the plague.\

It is however a decent party room, since it is quite far from the RCA room (on a different floor and down a long hallway) and is already in terrible condition so parties can't make it any worse anyway.

The big downside is that the bedrooms are tiny--we were barely able to unbunk our beds if we detached the closets from the wall, moved one into the hallway, and lofted one bed so a desk and a dresser fit underneath it.

On the negative end: the room is hot-dog shaped, all your furniture has to be on the same side of the wall. There's a little nook you can shove your dresser into but that's about it. I put my bed on risers (but not lofted) and was able to cram my fridge, laundry, and other stuff under it, good space saver. The room can also get quite hot, but opening the window usually takes care of that (hope you don't have allergies). Lighting is not great at all, but the window actually lets in quite a bit of light and if you bring a lamp you'll be fine. The only other non-size related issue with it goes along with proximity to the bathroom -- the stalls next door are super spring-loaded, so although you can't hear people going to the bathroom or anything (thank god), if people let the doors slam back it will often bounce several times and shake the walls in the process.\

The room itself is spacious, and my roommate and I had plenty of room for all our belongings and free space in the middle of the room (we even put an extra dresser on the wall opposite the windows).  After all though, a spacious room is a spacious room, and this one was nothing special in that regard.\

HOWEVER, the closet and bathroom were particularly nice.  In addition to the main room having ample space, the 2 \"closets\" were in their own little space in a sort of mini-hallway on way to the bathroom (private full bath).  In that sense it was a \"walk-through\" closet.  Each side (one for each of us) had a long hanging rod, a shelf up above, and was deep enough to stash stuff easily (the shelf was high and thus perfect for rarely accessed storage).  The bathroom was nice (I mean who can complain about a private bath?), and I particularly enjoyed the fact that it featured a tub, not just a shower stall.  Another nice thing; it had a REAL glass mirror, not one of those polished metal failed attempts at a mirror.\

 You can hear absolutely everything from anybody who walks past Cuyler on three sides bc this room is at the end, but the location more than makes up for it.\
 Linoleum floors, but we used lots of rugs. The triple upstairs 122 is hardwood but shaped differently. \

\
-There are a lot of windows which will help keep the room drafty during the warm months, but on the colder side during the winter, especially the turret, which has poor insulation.\
-The bedrooms are extremely narrow, so any efforts to try and debunk would not be worth it.\
-Furniture placement is very key to making this room the best it can be. There is an awkward fireplace mantle that can prevent this.\
-There are a lot of house centipedes during the warm months. They usually disappear by late October and this is common to most Rocky rooms if not more.\
-Noise from the music room: the room rests on top of the music room in the basement and you are guaranteed to hear whatever plays down there. However, I personally have not had a problem with it in the bedroom and attempting to sleep.\
-Noise from the dumpster: EVERY morning, the dump truck comes by around 9:30-11:00 am to empty the dumpsters on the side of Witherspoon. This involves a good 5-10 minutes of loud metal clashing and banging. If you are not a heavy sleeper, this is your alarm clock because the dumpster is right there\
-Visibility: with the curtains up, most adjacent 03 quads can see what's up in your room\
-Being on the first floor is quite convenient for the printer, kitchen, and exits\
-Bathrooms: in the 2014-2015 year, the adjacent bathroom was women's and unfortunately we (men) were not able to change it, so we had to walk across the hall to use the bathroom\

\
Downsides: tremendous view of the Business Today office at 48 University Place. You can see in the review below that BT always left their lights on in 2006 and they've carried on the tradition into 2015. You can sometimes see the heads of people sitting at the desk in there, and then you have to wonder--can they see you too? If it bothers you, you can always go into 48 Uni late at night, get into the BT offices (password 1968), take a Hershey's Kiss, and flip the light switch--but it's kind of annoying to have to leave your room and do all that. The enterprising 233 resident might try to rig some remotely-controlled thing, like buy something where you can point across the way and press a button and have the light go out, but I never got around to it. \
\
Other downsides: lots of stairs. Climbing up, climbing down. Good luck getting a futon up here, man! Also, it can get hot, but then you just open a window. \

The radiator is taller than average and breaks frequently. I had to get a portable heater from facilities because they can't fix it when it's still cold outside. Once it started to warm up they fixed it and it broke again a few days later. There is a large gap under the door, so when the window is open and it is windy there is a whooshing sound. One wall is shared with the women's bathroom, and the doors on the stalls in there automatically slam shut, which you will hear at all hours of the day.

Get a lot of fans for the warm months because the room doesnt get a lot of circulation.\
If getting a couch, put it next to the window seat to get a sectional kind of seating area.\
If the light in the entry area bothers you at night, put some dark colored duct tape over it. It comes off easily when moving out and fire safety shouldnt bother you about it.\

There is really only one wall that's completely usable for something the size of a bed because the other three are covered in doors and windows. Bunking is really the only option.

The room is also just kind of dark and dingy in general so get lots of lamps/lights. The bathroom is huge, but it's also bare so you'll definitely need some shelves in there and in the shower.

There is plenty of space, and it is the only room in the tower next to Blair arch - amazing view, with seminar rooms above. "{"4"{"Forbes Addition"{"A263"{"166"{"1"{"1"{"1"{"2"{"PU"
"2015-09-21"{"This room is a pleasant surprise. The L shaped configuration allows for the room to be divided in a way that ensures each roommate has his/her own private space within the shared room space. There is really PLENTY of space. \
\
Both legs of the L have windows facing the Wilson courtyard. There is an open closet space with about 3 or 4 feet of closet rack for each roommate with two shelves above. The floors are wood cross-hatched squares. Normal cinderblock walls which can make Command Hooks a hassle. The window fits a box fan nicely. Noise in adjacent rooms or men's bathroom was not an issue. The dresser has 5 deep drawers. Desk has 3 drawers on the side with a long and shallow drawer in the middle. \
\
I recommend placing the bookshelf on top of the dresser. \

Furniture: 4 long book cases (these can be stacked on top of one another and put in the common room for more space in bedrooms), 4 desks (only one can fit in each bedroom), 4 beds (can only be bunked), 4 wardrobes (with two drawers), 4 clothing chests (4 drawers) \

You can put a micro-fridge in this room. You may try put bean bags in the common room, but there is not a lot of room. You have a fireplace which is not functional. \

Location: Bathrooms are either upstairs or downstairs only a few steps away. Printer is downstairs just to the left coming down the stairs. The University Store is just around the corner as well as the gym. Very good location if you spend most of time up campus. \

"2016-01-29"{"It's a good-size room, plenty of floor space. The closet has no doors, though, so you might want to buy curtains or something to cover it up. Four large windows. Standard junior slum problems: rickety heating, bad floors, etc.\
\
The women's bathroom is one floor up on the fourth floor, but has just one toilet and one shower. Our year they made the men's bathroom (2nd floor), which has two showers and three toilets, co-ed. Suggest that to your DA. \
\
The kitchen is nice, it's private and only independents use it so it stays relatively clean and your food is less likely to be stolen. Also has a nice size dining area and you get a cupboard to store things in.\

"2016-02-11"{"This room definitely grows on you. It takes some work to get it set up just right, but it can be exactly what you want if you put in the time. My direct roommate and I unbunked our beds and our other roommates kept theirs bunked. Unbunking came at the expense of some loss of storage because instead of dressers, this room has built in drawers. However, we are much happier with our beds unbunked. It really just depends on your preferences, but both can work. There are definitely quads out there with bigger common rooms, but I haven't seen a quad in Mathey with bigger bedrooms, so it's pretty balanced. The best things about this room are the size of the bedrooms, the high ceilings, proximity to the bathroom and elevator. Also, if the windows are closed, the room is very quiet at night, even if the neighbors are playing loud music and having people over. The negatives are the distance to the laundry room and printer, and that the room is super dark. My friends affectionately call it the cave. Overall though, the room is pretty great!"{"4"{"Forbes Addition"{"A237"{"293"{"3"{"0"{"2"{"2"{"PU"
"2016-02-12"{"I agree with the previous posters. You likely have this as your freshman room. You are very lucky to have it. I do have three minor negatives:\
\
1. Garbage trucks empty the dumpsters directly below this room early in the mornings. This can be a minor nuisance.\
2. You will not be able to control the temperature. Usually, it will be either too hot or too cold. Often significantly so. In my case it was usually too hot. I once forgot to crack my window and came back to an 81 degree Fahrenheit room.\
3. If you are a male you will have to go either a floor up or a floor down for a men's room. This is not ideal.\
\
In all though, enjoy this spacious second floor room while you can.  You will be spoiled for next year; it is unlikely you will have a room (much less a single) this big or nice as a sophomore."{"5"{"Forbes Addition"{"A236"{"180"{"2"{"0"{"1"{"2"{"PU"
"2016-02-20"{"There's not too much space in this room. At the same time if you're smart about how you use it you will get a lot out of it. My roommate and I had each of our beds on opposite sides of the room, and took criss crossing desks, so I had the left side of the room and the right desk that way if you're working late at night the light doesn't bother your roommate. \
The closets are pretty crappy, you only get a small indent in the wall, but each person also gets like four drawers which definitely helps. \
You can't really sprawl out that much, but it's good for the basics, watching movies on a tv just put the tv at the end of the room so you can watch from your bed, and the desk area is kind of cozy. It's not a big desk area, but these days with computers you don't really need a big space to write an essay, cause you can have everything you need on your laptop.\
Some of the perks are there's a great lounge nearby on  this floor which makes for a great time hanging out with your floor-mates and your RCA. \
The view in this room is also really nice. \
It's a small room, but I think if you have a good relationship with your roommate, you'll be fine. I think it helps when you're willing to do stuff like studying at the library at least part of the time when your roommate is watching TV or vice versa. \
Also, you're close to Nassau Street and Dillon Gym and the dining area. \
I feel like you gotta have good communication with your roommate in a room like this. "{"4"{"Forbes Addition"{"A234"{"180"{"2"{"0"{"1"{"2"{"PU"

Very spacious and easy to entertain in, though the stair gets a bit noisy at night. Both bathrooms are upstairs, but you have the benefit of being right above the washing machines and study room.

"2016-04-04"{"Ok, so this suite has a pretty nice common room and a bathroom. There are 5 rooms (3 doubles, 2 singles). There is one room that is really narrow, so what we did was we debunked the beds and moved one of them into the largest single. That meant that we ended up with one huge single, but that room also shares a very thin wall with the common room, which can get kind of loud from time to time. We kept all the desks from the doubles in the common room, which took a little bit of arranging, but ended up being pretty good. The doubles were comfortable (no way you can have debunked bed and desks in there though - we debunked, but kept desks outside). \
\
There is a little balcony/emergency exit that we're not \"supposed\" to use, but its really nice.
